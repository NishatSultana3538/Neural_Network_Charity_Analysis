# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:
Our goal here is to use machine learning and neural networks, to use the  features in the provided dataset to help create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

We use the following methods for the analysis:

* reprocessing the data for the neural network model,
* compile, train and evaluate the model,
* optimize the model.
